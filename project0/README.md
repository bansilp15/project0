Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website contains 5 html files and 5 related css files with 1 scss files. Each html file is related 5 different webpages that I have created. 
Following are the details of those file i.e. what each files contains:

1. index.html & index.css: index.html file contains code for the structure of the homepage. I have used grid layout for different countries tour packages.
User can navigate to other 4 pages using the vertical menu bar provided in the website. index.css is used for teh designing of the homepage.

2. sign_in.html & sign_in.css: sign_in.html contains the code for the sign in page which asks user to enter username and password. sign_in.css has
related designing code for the sing in page.

3. sign_up.html & sign_up.css: sign_up.html contains the code for the sign up page which requires user to enter first name, last name, age, email id and 
password. User can navigate to the other pages if he/ she wishes to. Same as others, sign_up.css has the designing code for the html page. 

4. hotel.html & hotel.css: This page is different from others as it contains a table which shows teh list of hotels available for the customers in different 
countries with related prices. To build this table, I have used table, thead, tr, td, etc. tags along with some bootstrap classes.

5. car_rental.html & related scss files: car_rental.html webpage is used by the users to rent a car if they wishes to. This page was structured same as
sign up page. However, user has to enter different details to book his/ her reservation. I have created a scss file which uses variables, nesting and
inheritance. Then, I compiled this file to generate css file.
